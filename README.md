# Using Transfer Learning and Machine Learning to design Cardiovascular Diseases risk calculators

## What's in this repository?

This repository contains the code of our work presented on the [26th Euromicro Conference Series on Digital System Design (DSD)](https://dsd-seaa2023.com/) in Durres, Albania, in September of 2023: 
[*"Novel Approach for AI-based Risk Calculator Development using Transfer Learning Suitable for Embedded Systems"*](https://dsd-seaa2023.com/). This works present a methodology for the preliminary
design of a risk calculator using tabular medical databases based on Machine Learning (ML), combining the knowledge of different clinically validated cardiovascular risk calculators using Transfer Learning, 
aiming a more personalized NCD risk estimation that the current regression-based methods. This works is enclosed in the [WARIFA European Project]([h](https://www.warifa.eu/), whose main ojective is to 
develop an AI-based smartphone application to prevent chronic conditions, such as Diabetes Mellitus or Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) by providing personalized recommendations depending on the subject and the variables that are collected from him. So, a preliminary basic high-level performance profiling has been also done to estimate the feasibility of implement this ML-based calculator in a micro-controller.
